On one side it is 1 foot off the ground and on the highest side it is 3 feet off the ground. So not only will you rotate when you are on the disk spinner, but you will go up and down. Users can sit or lay on the disk, or for a more challenging adventure, stand on the disk and rotate it by walking. The disk spinner is 12 inches high on one side, which is a bit high to transfer from a wheelchair so it would be good to have some assistance to do it.

So best if you are visually impaired to ask folks to stop the 1carousel before approaching it.  The carousel has two benches for up to 3 people each to sit on while riding the carousel and also has two magical parking spaces for wheelchairs. To transfer a wheelchair onto the ground carousel simply lift the safety rail, roll into the space provided and park the wheelchair.

A person standing next to the net spinner can push on the ropes in a circular direction causing the entire net spinner to rotate. Many people can climb on the net or sit safely on the disk inside at once. Not only is the net spinner a climbing challenge but you will get some good stimulus to your balance (vestibular) system if someone rotates the net spinning while you are at the top. Keep in mind the whole thing can spin as you are at a height of 8 or more feet off the ground. How do you know if you are ready to climb to the top of the net spinner?

The disk spinner almost looks like an enormous thumbtack that isnâ€™t put in the ground perfectly straight.   The disk is around 5 feet in diameter.    On one side it is 1 foot off the ground and on the highest side it is 3 feet off the ground. So not only will you rotate when you are on the disk spinner, but you will go up and down. Users can sit or lay on the disk, or for a more challenging adventure, stand on the disk and rotate it by walking. The disk spinner is 12 inches high on one side, which is a bit high to transfer from a wheelchair so it would be good to have some assistance to do it.  Even those who canâ€™t move much or at all could be lifted and placed on the disk spinner for an enjoyable spin ride.",

So best if you are visually impaired to ask folks to stop the 1carousel before approaching it.  The carousel has two benches for up to 3 people each to sit on while riding the carousel and also has two magical parking spaces for wheelchairs. To transfer a wheelchair onto the ground carousel simply lift the safety rail, roll into the space provided and park the wheelchair.  Set the safety break on the wheelchair, then bring the safety rail down. If you have the arm strength to do it, you can â€œturnâ€ the disk in the middle of the spinner which will cause the whole carousel to rotate.",

The net is anchored at the bottom to a large horizontal disk about 8 feet in diameter and about 1 foot from the ground.  Coming up from the center of the disk is pole that is 12 feet.  A network of ropes is attached from the top of the pole to the outside edge of the disks to form a net that can be climbed on.  A person standing next to the net spinner can push on the ropes in a circular direction causing the entire net spinner to rotate. Many people can climb on the net or sit safely on the disk inside at once. Not only is the net spinner a climbing challenge but you will get some good stimulus to your balance (vestibular) system if someone rotates the net spinning while you are at the top. Keep in mind the whole thing can spin as you are at a height of 8 or more feet off the ground. How do you know if you are ready to climb to the top of the net spinner?  People should be comfortable with climbing short distances up and down the net before going to the top.",

There is one large opening in the front with room for one person to sit down in the cocoon, and there are smaller openings in the side and back of each cocoon to use as  a window to peer out at the playground.  The cocoon can be gently rotated so that the user or a helper can  rotate it away from the action and noise. A cocoon's main purpose is to be a calming, cozy place to regroup while observing from the round openings in the cocoon and to re-emerge and re-engage in active play when ready.",

The Cozy Cocoon in the Spin Zone is one of three located throughout the playground. A Cozy Cocoon is shaped like a large sphere with openings. There is one large opening in the front with room for one person to sit down in the cocoon, and there are smaller openings in the side and back of each cocoon to use as  a window to peer out at the playground.  The cocoon can be gently rotated so that the user or a helper can  rotate it away from the action and noise. A cocoon's main purpose is to be a calming, cozy place to regroup while observing from the round openings in the cocoon and to re-emerge and re-engage in active play when ready.",

Users play to create an ambiance that is individual to the moment of interaction that reflects the broad idea of play thatâ€™s still fun and sophisticated.

There is one large opening in the front with room for one person to sit down in the cocoon, and there are smaller openings in the side and back of each cocoon to use as  a window to peer out at the playground.  The cocoon can be gently rotated so that the user or a helper can  rotate it away from the action and noise. A cocoon's main purpose is to be a calming, cozy place to regroup while observing from the round openings in the cocoon and to re-emerge and re-engage in active play when ready.",
